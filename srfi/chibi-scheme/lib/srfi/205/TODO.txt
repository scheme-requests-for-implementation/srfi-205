For each release:

 * Fix errors reported by W3C HTML Validator.
 * Fix spelling.

----------------

Rename gtty, it's overloaded with a previous not the same use and is
not descriptive of what it does.

----------------

Split tests into "works for all" with-* etc., and serial line
manipulation; for the latter, why not an echo server?

----------------

Consider adding miscellaneous scsh procedures per
https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-205/msg/14647343/

 * (open-control-tty tty-name [flags])
 * (become-session-leader)
 * (tty-process-group fd/port/fname)
 * (set-tty-process-group fd/port/fname pgrp)
 * (control-tty-file-name)

----------------

HTML: Add examples to Error Handling section.

HUP in Linux is same as POSIX HUPCL, "Hang up on last close."

----

POSIX defines baud rate B<numbers>, investigate.

RTS/CTS RS-232 flow control is accounted for with a CRTSCTS flag in
asm-generic/termbits.h and x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/termios.h in Linux
and sys/termios.h in OpenBSD
