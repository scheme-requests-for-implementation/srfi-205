For each release:

 * Fix errors reported by W3C HTML Validator.
 * Fix spelling.

----------------

Split tests into "works for all" with-* etc., and serial line
manipulation; for the latter, why not an echo server?

----------------

Consider adding miscellaneous scsh procedures per
https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-205/msg/14647343/

 * (open-control-tty tty-name [flags])
 * (become-session-leader)
 * (tty-process-group fd/port/fname)
 * (set-tty-process-group fd/port/fname pgrp)
 * (control-tty-file-name)

----------------

From Lassi, "Does SRFI 205 cover serial port?" discussion:

One thing currently missing from 205 is TIOCGWINSZ (window size):

struct winsize ws;
if (ioctl(fd, TIOCGWINSZ, &ws) == -1) error();
width  = ws.ws_col;
height = ws.ws_row;

----------------

Add examples to Error Handling section.
