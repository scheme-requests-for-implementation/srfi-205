For each release:

 * Fix errors reported by W3C HTML Validator.
 * Fix spelling.

----------------

Split tests into "works for all" with-* etc., and serial line
manipulation; for the latter, why not an echo server?

----------------

Consider adding miscellaneous scsh procedures per
https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-205/msg/14647343/

 * (open-control-tty tty-name [flags])
 * (become-session-leader)
 * (tty-process-group fd/port/fname)
 * (set-tty-process-group fd/port/fname pgrp)
 * (control-tty-file-name)

----------------

HTML: add terminal-dimensions.

----------------

HTML: Add examples to Error Handling section.

----------------

Adjustments to what in termios can or should be changeble:

Mostly harmless? but not supported in OpenBSD:

Delays:

BS0-1
CF0-3
FF0-1
NL0-1
TAB0-3, but TAB3 changes tabs to spaces
TABS is synonym for TAB0, inverse is TAB3
OFILL, "Use fill characters for delay."
OFDEL, "Fill is DEL."

HUP in Linux is same as POXIS HUPCL, "Hang up on last close."

POSIX defines baud rate B<numbers>, investigate.
