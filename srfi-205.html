<h2>Status</h2>



<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This SRFI describes procedures for command-line and terminal interface
programs to use to safely change and reset terminal modes, for example
from cooked to raw and back, and for serial-line device manipulation
for interfacing with embedded hardware and the like.
</p>


<h2>Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>
How to prescribe and/or enforce safe use of <code>with-cooked-mode</code>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Whether to include serial line procedures in this, or a separate SRFI.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Whether to support <code>stty(1)</code> style getting and setting of
all of a special device's modes.
</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>
P<small>OSIX</small> provides a complete set of routines for
manipulating terminal devices &mdash; putting them in "raw" mode,
changing and querying their special characters, modifying their I/O
speeds, and so forth.
Now that terminal emulators have almost completely displaced
terminals, very little of this is useful except for directly
controlling serial-line hardware, which is still widely used for
embedded programming and applications.
</p>
<p>
This SRFI provides safe high level wrappers for raw, no echo etc.
terminal modes for use by command-line programs and textual user
interfaces, and a procedure to set a serial line's characteristics
such as its baud rate.
</p>
<p>
These two disparate use cases are bundled together in one SRFI because
the complicated low level infrastructure for implementing either is
roughly the same, except for different sets of constants, which are
presumably cheap to implement.
</p>
<p>
This SRFI depends on SRFI 198, Foreign Interface Error Handling.
Various procedures in SRFI 170, from which it was forked off of, may
be useful in concert with it.
</p>


<h2>Specification</h2>

<h3>Error handling</h3>

<p>
The procedures of this SRFI signal an exception when the underlying
system calls fail, as documented in
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-198/srfi-198.html">SRFI 198</a>.
The failure of system calls is in the <code>'errno</code> collection
of <code>error-set</code>, and sanity checks before they are called
are in <code>'error</code>.
</p>


<h3>Miscellaneous procedures</h3>

<p>See also the <code>terminal?</code> procedure in
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-170/srfi-170.html">SRFI 170</a>,
which returns <code>#t</code> if the supplied port argument is a terminal.
</p>

<code>(terminal-file-name <i>port</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>string</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>ttyname()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>
The argument <i>port</i> must be open on a terminal.
Returns the file name of the terminal.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(terminal-file-name &lt;a-serial-line-port&gt;) &rArr; "/dev/ttyS0"
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h3>Serial line manipulation</h3>

<code>(stty <i>port . args</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>undefined</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>tcgetattr(), tcsetattr()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>
Use in the manner of P<small>OSIX</small> <code>stty(1)</code>, as
extended to allow specifying the special device file to be
manipulated, here as associated to a port.
</p>
<p>
</p>
The supported arguments are:
<p>
</p>
[<i>To be determined.</i>]
<p>
<pre class="example">
(stty &lt;port-for-a-serial-device&gt; 9600) &rArr; <i>undefined</i>, sets baud rate to 9600.
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h3>Safe terminal I/O primitives</h3>

<p>
The following procedures use <code>dynamic-wind</code> when executing
their <code><i>proc</i></code> procedure argument.
If <i><code>proc</code>'s</i> dynamic extent is escaped, the terminal
mode changes of the containing <code>with-</code>
or <code>without-</code> procedure are undone, but if
<i><code>proc</code>'s</i> dynamic extent is re-entered, the terminal
mode changes of the containing procedure are restored to their
previous state.  They all use P<small>OSIX</small>
<code>tcgetattr()</code> and <code>tcsetattr()</code>; see also
the <code>stty</code> command.
</p>

<p>
The general paradigm for using <code>with-raw-mode</code>
and <code>with-rare-mode</code> is to set up your application, then
run it in the <code><i>proc</i></code> provided to them, a procedure
that takes the same port arguments in the same order as the
containing <code>with-</code> or <code>without-</code> procedure.
When inside <code><i>proc</i></code>, <code>with-cooked-mode</code>
can be used for a temporarily escape, for instance to a shell.
The <code>without-echo</code> procedure is an exception in that it's
generally used to enter a password or passphrase.  The procedures
return the values that <code><i>proc</i></code> returns.
</p>

<code>(with-raw-mode <i>input-port output-port min time proc</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>[values]</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>stty -ECHO -ICANON -IEXTEN -ISIG -BRKINT -ICRNL -INPCK -ISTRIP -IXON -CSIZE -PARENB CS8 -OPOST VMIN=<i>min</i> VTIME=<i>time</i></code>
<blockquote>
<p>
The port arguments must be opened on a terminal.
The terminal is set to raw mode during the dynamic execution of <code>proc</code>
and then is restored to canonical "cooked" mode.
The effect of the <i>min</i> and <i>time</i> arguments is that any
reads done on the terminal while raw mode is in effect will return to
the caller after <i>min</i> bytes have been read or <i>time</i>
deciseconds (1/10ths of a second) have elapsed, whichever comes first.
Therefore, it makes no sense to use any read operation on the terminal
except <code>read-char</code> or <code>read-string</code>,
which read a fixed number of characters.
No character is given special handling; all are passed to the
application exactly as received.
Echoing of input is disabled on the terminal during the execution
of <code>proc</code>.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(with-raw-mode (current-input-port) (current-output-port)
               2 50
               (lambda (x y) (read-char) (read-char))) &rArr; #\x03
</pre>
</blockquote>

<code>(with-rare-mode <i>input-port output-port proc</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><i>[values]</i></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>stty -ICANON -ECHO VMIN=1 VTIME=0</code>
<blockquote>
<p>
The port arguments must be opened on a terminal.
The terminal is set to "rare", also known as cbreak mode during the
dynamic execution of <code>proc</code>, and then is restored to
canonical "cooked" mode.
Just as in canonical mode, any read operation on the terminal
will wait until characters are received, unlike raw mode.
However, no characters are given special interpretation except
the characters that send signals (by default, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-\).
Echoing of input is disabled on the terminal during the execution
of <code>proc</code>.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(with-rare-mode (current-input-port) (current-output-port)
                (lambda (x y) (read-char))) &rArr; #\newline
</pre>
</blockquote>

<code>(with-cooked-mode <i>input-port output-port proc</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><i>[values]</i></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>stty ~~~FIX_ME</code>
<blockquote>
<p>
The port arguments must be opened on a terminal.
The terminal is set to canonical "cooked" during the dynamic execution
of <code>proc</code>, and then is restored to the previous mode.
In canonical mode, any read operation on the terminal will wait until
characters are received, and no characters are given special
interpretation.
The characters that send signals (by default, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-\) may
well terminate the instance of Scheme you are using, so it is wise to
quickly switch to a subprocess such as a shell.
</p>
<pre class="example">
~~~FIX_ME add example

</blockquote>

<code>(without-echo <i>input-port output-port proc</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><i>[values]</i></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>stty -ECHO -ECHOE -ECHOK -ECHONL</code>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<p>
The port arguments must be opened on a terminal.
Echoing of input is disabled on the terminal during the execution of <code>proc</code>
and then is re-enabled.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(without-echo (current-input-port) (current-output-port)
              (lambda (x) (read-string 8 (current-input-port)))) &rArr; "12345678"
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>
A Chibi Scheme sample implementation will be created after the API
settles down.
