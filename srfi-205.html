<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This SRFI describes procedures for command-line and terminal interface
programs to safely change and reset terminal modes, for example from
cooked to raw and back, and for serial-line device manipulation for
interfacing with embedded hardware and the like.
</p>
<p>
It is intended to provide all the
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/termios.h.html">termios structure</a>
functionality a modern Scheme programmer might desire by supplying a
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/stty.html">stty</a>
procedure, and simple abstractions on top of it.
</p>


<h2>Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>
Is the decision to put all termios manipulation in a single SRFI correct?
</p></li>
<li><p>
Are there any modern needs for exposed <code>stty(1)</code>
functionality besides serial-line manipulation for communication with
other systems?  (This SRFI does not propose to support retrocomputing
with real serial-line terminals.)
</p></li>
<li><p>
Exactly which <code>stty(1)</code> arguments are needed for modern
serial-line use, such as with embedded computing?
</p></li>
<li><p>
<code>with-cooked-mode</code> exists to "shell out" from a program
that's already executing the thunk handed
to <code>with-rare-mode</code> or <code>with-raw-mode</code>.  Does it
need arguments in addition to the standard triplet of input, output,
and error ports to do this safely and securely?
</p></li>
<li><p>
Is there any way to enforce, rather than prescribe, safe use
of <code>with-cooked-mode</code>?  If so, should that be done for the
good of users?
</p></li>
<li><p>
What are the best recommended <code>stty(1)</code> settings for
<code>with-cooked-mode</code>?
</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>
P<small>OSIX</small> provides a complete set of routines for
manipulating terminal devices &mdash; putting them in "raw" mode,
changing and querying their special characters, modifying their I/O
speeds, and so forth.
Now that terminal emulators have almost completely displaced
terminals, very little of this is useful except for directly
controlling serial-line hardware, which is still widely used for
embedded programming and applications.
</p>
<p>
This SRFI provides safe high-level wrappers for raw, no echo, etc.
terminal modes for use by command-line programs and textual user
interfaces (TUIs), and a <code>stty(1)</code> style procedure to set a
serial line's characteristics such as its baud rate.
</p>
<p>
These two disparate use cases are bundled together in one SRFI because
the complicated low-level infrastructure for implementing either is
roughly the same, except for different sets of constants, which are
presumably cheap to implement.  If you first implement
<code>stty</code>, the special terminal mode procedures can be
simply and elegantly built on top of it with a few lines of code.
</p>
<p>
This SRFI depends on
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-198/srfi-198.html">SRFI 198: Foreign Interface Error Handling.</a>
Various procedures or their equivalents in
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-170/srfi-170.html">SRFI 170: POSIX API</a>,
from which it was forked off of, are needed or may be useful in
concert with it.  It is based on the
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/mindex.html">2018 edition of P<small>OSIX</small> IEEE Std 1003.1-2017&trade;</a>.
</p>


<h2>Specification</h2>

<h3>Error handling</h3>

<p>
The procedures of this SRFI raise a SRFI 198 exception when an
underlying system call fails, as documented in SRFI 170.  These are in
the <code>'errno</code> error set collection, and sanity checks before
they are called are in <code>'error</code>.
</p>


<h3>Miscellaneous procedures</h3>

<p>See also the <code>terminal?</code> procedure in
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-170/srfi-170.html">SRFI 170</a>,
which returns <code>#t</code> if the supplied port argument is a terminal.
</p>

<code>(terminal-file-name <i>port</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>string</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>ttyname()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>
The argument <i>port</i> must be open on a terminal.
Returns the file name of the terminal.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(terminal-file-name &lt;a-serial-line-port&gt;) &rArr; "/dev/ttyS0"
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h3>Serial line manipulation</h3>

<code>(stty <i>port . args</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>undefined</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>tcgetattr(), tcsetattr()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>
Use in the manner of P<small>OSIX</small> <code>stty(1)</code>, as
extended to allow specifying the special device file to be
manipulated, here associated with a port.
</p>
<p>
</p>
The supported arguments are:
<p>
</p>
[<i>To be determined.</i>]
<p>
<pre class="example">
(stty &lt;port-for-a-serial-device&gt; 9600) &rArr; <i>undefined</i>, sets baud rate to 9600.
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h3>Safe terminal I/O primitives</h3>

<p>
The following procedures use <code>dynamic-wind</code> when executing
their <code><i>proc</i></code> procedure argument.
If <i><code>proc</code>'s</i> dynamic extent is escaped, the terminal
mode changes of the containing <code>with-</code>
or <code>without-</code> procedure are undone, but if
<i><code>proc</code>'s</i> dynamic extent is re-entered, the terminal
mode changes of the containing procedure are restored to their
previous state.  They all use P<small>OSIX</small>
<code>tcgetattr()</code> and <code>tcsetattr()</code>; see also
the <code>stty</code> command.
</p>

<p>
The general paradigm for using <code>with-raw-mode</code>
and <code>with-rare-mode</code> is to set up your application, then
run it in the <code><i>proc</i></code> provided to them, a procedure
that takes the same port arguments in the same order as the
containing <code>with-</code> or <code>without-</code> procedure.
When inside <code><i>proc</i></code>, <code>with-cooked-mode</code>
can be used for a temporarily escape, for instance to a shell.
The <code>without-echo</code> procedure is an exception in that it's
generally used to enter a password or passphrase.  The procedures
return the values that <code><i>proc</i></code> returns.
</p>

<code>(with-raw-mode <i>input-port output-port error-port min time proc</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>[values]</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>stty -ECHO -ICANON -IEXTEN -ISIG -BRKINT -ICRNL -INPCK -ISTRIP -IXON -CSIZE -PARENB CS8 -OPOST VMIN=<i>min</i> VTIME=<i>time</i></code>
<blockquote>
<p>
The port arguments must be opened on a terminal.
The terminal is set to raw mode during the dynamic execution of <code>proc</code>
and then is restored to canonical "cooked" mode.
The effect of the <i>min</i> and <i>time</i> arguments is that any
reads done on the terminal while raw mode is in effect will return to
the caller after <i>min</i> bytes have been read or <i>time</i>
deciseconds (1/10ths of a second) have elapsed, whichever comes first.
Therefore, it makes no sense to use any read operation on the terminal
except <code>read-char</code> or <code>read-string</code>,
which read a fixed number of characters.
No character is given special handling; all are passed to the
application exactly as received.
Echoing of input is disabled on the terminal during the execution
of <code>proc</code>.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(with-raw-mode (current-input-port) (current-output-port) (current-error-port)
               2 50
               (lambda (x y) (read-char) (read-char))) &rArr; #\x03
</pre>
</blockquote>

<code>(with-rare-mode <i>input-port output-port error-port proc</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><i>[values]</i></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>stty -ICANON -ECHO VMIN=1 VTIME=0</code>
<blockquote>
<p>
The port arguments must be opened on a terminal.
The terminal is set to "rare", also known as cbreak mode, during the
dynamic execution of <code>proc</code>, and then is restored to
canonical "cooked" mode.
Just as in canonical mode, any read operation on the terminal
will wait until characters are received, unlike raw mode.
However, no characters are given special interpretation except
the characters that send signals (by default, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-\).
Echoing of input is disabled on the terminal during the execution
of <code>proc</code>.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(with-rare-mode (current-input-port) (current-output-port) (current-error-port)
                (lambda (x y) (read-char))) &rArr; #\newline
</pre>
</blockquote>

<code>(with-cooked-mode <i>input-port output-port error-port proc</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><i>[values]</i></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>stty CREAD BRKINT ICRNL IMAXBEL OPOST ONCR ISIG ICANON ECHO ECHOE ECHOCTL ECHOEK -IGNBRK -IGNCR -IXOFF -IXANY -INLCR -OCRNL -ONOCR -ONLRET -ECHONL -NOFLSH -TOSTOP -ECHOPRT</code>
<blockquote>
<p>
The port arguments must be opened on a terminal.
The terminal is set to canonical "cooked" mode during the dynamic
execution of <code>proc</code>, and then is restored to the previous
mode.
In canonical mode, any read operation on the terminal will wait until
characters are received, and no characters are given special
interpretation.
The characters that send signals (by default, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-\) may
well terminate the instance of Scheme you are using, so it is wise to
quickly switch to a subprocess such as a shell.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(with-cooked-mode &lt;input-port&gt; &lt;output-port&gt; &lt;error-port&gt;
                  (lambda (x y z) (&lt;spawn-shell-process&gt; x y z))) &rArr; 0
</pre>
</blockquote>

<code>(without-echo <i>input-port output-port proc</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><i>[values]</i></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>stty -ECHO -ECHOE -ECHOK -ECHONL</code>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<p>
The port arguments must be opened on a terminal.
Echoing of input is disabled on the terminal during the execution of <code>proc</code>
and then is re-enabled.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(without-echo (current-input-port) (current-output-port)
              (lambda (x) (read-string 8 (current-input-port)))) &rArr; "12345678"
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>
A Chibi Scheme sample implementation will be created after the API
settles down.
</p>


<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>
Alex Shinn conceived the operating paradigm for the
<code>with-*</code> and <code>without-echo</code> procedures,
which minimizes the classic risk of leaving a terminal in an
odd, often non-echoing state.
